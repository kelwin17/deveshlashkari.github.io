			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm a web-designer & front-end developer. At present I am pursuing Computer Science Engineering. I like to solve and code Algorithms.


I,m a fast-learner. I enjoy a challenge and look for the opportunity to expand and develop my skill set.


When I'm not burying myself in studies, I'm most likely playing Counter Strike.
